## PokemonGO Pokemon Renders

Using the sprite of very tiny PNGs in PokemonGo (APK), I then converted them to SVGs using vectors. Vectoring a variety of source images (large/small) proved to be difficult. So some vectors have to be manually touched up. What was left was a real vector style look of Pokemon.

All copyright is towards The Pokemon Company and I will honor any request to remove this images.
